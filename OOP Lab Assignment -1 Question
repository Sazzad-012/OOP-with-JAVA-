Assignment Title: Bank Account Management System
Objective:
In this assignment, you will implement a Bank Account Management System in Java using class,
object, static methods, public/private access modifiers, and setter/getter methods. You will create
a program that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as depositing and withdrawing money, while ensuring proper balance management and tracking total bank funds.

Requirements:
1. Create a class BankAccount with the following private attributes:
    ○ accountNumber (integer) – Unique account number.
    ○ accountHolder (String) – Name of the account holder.
    ○ balance (double) – The account balance.
2. Define the following static variables in the BankAccount class:
    ○ totalAccounts (integer) – Tracks the total number of accounts created.
    ○ totalBankBalance (double) – Tracks the total balance across all accounts.
3. Implement the following methods in BankAccount:
    ○ Constructor:
       ■ Takes accountNumber, accountHolder, and initialBalance as parameters.
       ■ Ensures that the initialBalance is at least 500 (if not, sets it to 500).
       ■ Increments totalAccounts and updates totalBankBalance.
    ○ Setter & Getter Methods:
       ■ setAccountHolder(String name) and getAccountHolder()
       ■ setAccountNumber(int number) and getAccountNumber()
       ■ getBalance() (no setter for balance, as deposits/withdrawals will update it)
    ○ Transaction Methods:
       ■ deposit(double amount): Adds money to the account. Amount must be positive.
       ■ withdraw(double amount): Deducts money from the account only if the balance remains above 500.

    ○ Static Methods:
       ■ getTotalAccounts(): Returns the total number of accounts.
       ■ getTotalBankBalance(): Returns the total balance in the bank.

Main Class: BankMain
  ● Create a separate BankMain class with the main method.
  ● In the main method, perform the following tasks:
1. Create three BankAccount objects with different account numbers and initial balances.
2. Perform deposit and withdrawal operations for different accounts.
3. Try withdrawing an amount that violates the minimum balance rule.
4. Print the account details (Account Holder, Account Number, Balance).
5. Call the static methods to display the total number of accounts and total bank balance.

Sample output:
Initial deposit must be at least 500. Setting balance to 500.
Deposited: 500.0. New balance: 1500.0
Withdrawn: 300.0. New balance: 400.0
Insufficient balance! Minimum balance of 500 must be maintained.
Account 1: Alice (Account No: 1001), Balance: 1500.0
Account 2: Bob (Account No: 1002), Balance: 400.0
Account 3: Charlie (Account No: 1003), Balance: 500.0
Total accounts: 3
Total bank balance: 2400.0
