Assignment Type 1: Student Result Processing System
You are to create a mini “Student Result Processing System” that performs the following:
1. Takes input from the user:
○ Student name
○ Score in 3 subjects
2. You must use predefined exceptions to handle:
○ Invalid number input (NumberFormatException)
○ Division by zero or invalid array access (ArithmeticException,
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException)

3. You must create a custom exception named InvalidScoreException that is thrown when:
○ Any subject score is less than 0
○ Any subject score is greater than 100
4. Implement a method calculateAverage(int[] marks) that:
○ Uses throws InvalidScoreException
○ Performs validation inside the method
○ Uses throw to trigger the custom exception
5. In the main() method:
○ Use try-catch to handle:
■ Predefined exceptions
■ Custom exceptions
○ If everything is valid, print:
■ Student name
■ Individual marks
■ Average score

Assignment type 2 : Bank Withdrawal Validation Using Exceptions
Write a Java program that simulates a simple bank withdrawal system.
Requirements:
1. The program should take two inputs from the user:
○ Current account balance
○ Amount to withdraw
2. You must handle the following predefined exceptions:
○ NumberFormatException → if user enters non-numeric values
○ ArithmeticException → if withdrawal amount is zero or negative
3. Create a custom exception (checked) named InsufficientBalanceException that is thrown
when:
○ The withdrawal amount is greater than the account balance

Implement a static and void method withdraw which takes two parameters, balance(double) and
amount(double) also that throws InsufficientBalanceException.
4. This method should:
○ Validate the withdrawal
○ Throw the custom exception if the balance is insufficient
○ Print the updated balance if withdrawal is successful
5. Handle all exceptions in the main() method.
Sample inputs/outputs (different cases) :
# Input 
Enter balance:
5000
Enter withdrawal amount:
1500

# Output
Withdrawal successful.
Remaining balance: 3500.0

# Input 
Enter balance:
abc

# Output
Invalid input: Please enter numbers only.

# Input 
Enter balance:
3000
Enter withdrawal amount:
-200

# Output
Error: Withdrawal amount must be greater than zero.

# Input 
Enter balance:
2000
Enter withdrawal amount:
5000

# Output 
Insufficient balance: Cannot withdraw more than existing balance.

# Input 
Enter balance:
1000
Enter withdrawal amount:
1000

# Output 
Withdrawal successful.
Remaining balance: 0.0
