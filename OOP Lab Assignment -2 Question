// Employee Management System 
/* Objective:
In this assignment, you will implement an Employee Management System in Java using class, object,
static variable/method, inheritance, final keyword, polymorphism, dynamic method dispatch, and
arrays of objects. The program will demonstrate employee salary computation for different roles
while enforcing rules through conditional setters and using an array to manage multiple employees.
Requirements:
1. Create a base class Employee with the following private attributes:
○ empId (integer) – Unique employee ID.
○ name (String) – Employee name.
○ basicSalary (double) – Basic salary.
2. Define additional elements in the Employee class:
○ A final variable COMPANY_NAME set to "TechNova Pvt. Ltd.".
○ A static variable totalEmployees to track the total number of employees created.
○ A constructor that initializes empId, name, and basicSalary.
■ If the basicSalary is less than 10000, print a message and set it to 10000.
■ Increment totalEmployees each time an employee is created.
○ Setter and Getter methods:
■ setName(String name) – Valid only if the name is not empty or null.
■ setBasicSalary(double salary) – If less than 10000, set to 10000 and display a
message.
■ Getter methods for all attributes.
○ A method calculateSalary() that returns the basicSalary.
3. Create subclasses that inherit from Employee:
○ Manager class
■ Additional attribute: performanceBonus.
■ Overrides calculateSalary() to return basicSalary + performanceBonus.
○ Developer class
■ Additional attribute: projectAllowance.
■ Overrides calculateSalary() to return basicSalary + projectAllowance.

4. Use the final keyword appropriately:
○ Make the company name constant using final.
○ Make one method (like displayCompanyName()) final so subclasses cannot override it.
5. Add static methods in Employee:
○ getTotalEmployees() – Returns the total number of employees created.
6. Use an array of objects:
○ Create an array (e.g., Employee[] employees = new Employee[3];) to store both
Manager and Developer objects.
○ Use dynamic method dispatch to call overridden methods (calculateSalary()) via
Employee references.

Main Class: EmployeeMain
In the main method:
1. Create an array of size 3 to store employee objects.
2. Instantiate at least one Manager and one Developer object using the parameterized
constructor.
3. Use setter methods to update employee details (demonstrating conditional setters).
4. Store all objects in the array.
5. Use a loop to:
○ Display employee details (ID, Name, Company, Salary).
○ Call calculateSalary() polymorphically for each object.
6. Finally, display the total number of employees using the static method getTotalEmployees().

Sample output:
Invalid salary! Setting basic salary to 10000.0
Employee created at TechNova Pvt. Ltd.
Manager Salary Calculated: 18000.0
Developer Salary Calculated: 16000.0

Employee Details:
ID: 101 | Name: Alice | Company: TechNova Pvt. Ltd. | Salary: 18000.0
ID: 102 | Name: Bob | Company: TechNova Pvt. Ltd. | Salary: 16000.0
ID: 103 | Name: Charlie | Company: TechNova Pvt. Ltd. | Salary: 10000.0
