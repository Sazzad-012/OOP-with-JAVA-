Design a simple Gaming Character System using abstract class and interface in Java.
Requirements:
1. Create an interface named CharacterActions with the following methods:
○ void attack();
○ void defend();
○ void gainExperience(int points);
2. Create an abstract class named GameCharacter that implements the
CharacterActions interface and contains:
○ Protected variables: String name, int level, and int experience.
○ A constructor to initialize these variables.
○ A concrete method showStats() to display the character’s current stats.
○ The methods attack() and defend() should be declared abstract here.
3. Create a concrete subclass named Warrior that extends GameCharacter and
provides:
○ Implementations for attack() and defend().
○ Each successful attack should call gainExperience() and increase experience
points.
○ The level should increase by 1 every time experience reaches or exceeds 100
points.

4. In the main class GameSystem, do the following:
○ Create a Warrior object with an initial name, level, and experience.
○ Perform a series of attacks and defenses.
○ Display character stats after each action.

Character Created: Aragon
Level: 1 | Experience: 0
Aragon attacks fiercely with a sword!
Experience gained: 40
Aragon defends with a shield!
Aragon attacks fiercely with a sword!
Experience gained: 60
Level up! Aragon reached Level 2
Final Stats:
Name: Aragon | Level: 2 | Experience: 0
